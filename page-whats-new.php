      <h2>MS Teams Bot</h2>
      <p>As so many of us have been working from home we have become more reliant on Microsoft Team. To leverage this, Hoth have produced the Teams Integration add on which lets you log tickets directly from Teams and use it as a Notification channel.</p>

      <h2>In the Loop</h2>
      <p>Keep users notified of ticket updates even when they are not actively assigned to the call, send email updates to users as and when needed.</p>
      <p>You can add users to be kept ‘In the Loop’ on ticket updates, and take them away when they no longer are required.</p>
