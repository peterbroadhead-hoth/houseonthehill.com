      <h2>MS Teams Bot</h2>
      <p>As so many of us have been working from home we have become more reliant on Microsoft Team. To leverage this, Hoth have produced the Teams Integration add on which lets you log tickets directly from Teams and use it as a Notification channel.</p>

      <h2>In the Loop</h2>
      <p>Keep users notified of ticket updates even when they are not actively assigned to the call, send email updates to users as and when needed.</p>
      <p>You can add users to be kept ‘In the Loop’ on ticket updates, and take them away when they no longer are required.</p>

      <h2>OAuth 2.0 Email</h2>
      <p>Microsoft have flagged Basic authentication to be disabled mid 2021 so Hoth now supports OAuth2 for SMTP, POP, IMAP and LDAP Connections. We have produced several guides to the implementation process and as always, our Support Team will be available to help.</p>

      <h2>Email</h2>
      <p><strong>E-Mail Settings Tidy up and consolidation</strong> <br>This is really for new systems, if your email is already set up already and working then don’t mess with it. But if you go to the Settings Cog and Email Settings you will see it is easy to navigate to the outbound and inbound mail Settings.</p>

      <p>And you can see from the image above that we have added a filter box to help you find the mail template you are looking for.
<br><br> If you have a lot of User Defined templates, you might find it useful to know if the template is used by any Categories. If it isn’t linked to a Category, you can delete a User Defined Email Template, should you have a need to tidy up.</p>

      <p><strong>Pick the columns shown when looking at Activities on a ticket.</strong> So many of you have asked for this! 
      As long as you are using the browser and have HouseForms, you can create a Form to determine the columns to show when listing Activities on a ticket.
      The Activity Summary Form must be called CallActivity_Summary_<folder:no></p>
